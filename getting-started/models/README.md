# Granite::ORM

## Installation

Add this library to your projects dependencies along with the driver in
your `shard.yml`.  This can be used with any framework but was originally
designed to work with the amber framework in mind.  This library will work 
with kemal or any other framework as well.

```yaml
dependencies:
  granite_orm:
    github: amberframework/granite-orm

  # Pick your database
  mysql:
    github: crystal-lang/crystal-mysql

  sqlite3:
    github: crystal-lang/crystal-sqlite3

  pg:
    github: will/crystal-pg

```

Next you will need to create a `config/database.yml`
You can leverage environment variables using `${}` syntax.

```yaml
mysql:
  database: "mysql://username:password@hostname:3306/database_${AMBER_ENV}"
pg:
  database: "postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/database"
sqlite:
  database: "sqlite3:./config/${DB_NAME}.db"
```

Or you can set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.  This will override the config/database.yml

## Usage

Here is an example using Granite ORM Model

```crystal
require "granite_orm/adapter/mysql"

class Post < Granite::ORM::Base
  adapter mysql
  field name : String
  field body : Text
  timestamps
end
```

You can disable the timestamps for SqlLite since TIMESTAMP is not supported for this database:
```crystal
require "granite_orm/adapter/sqlite"

class Comment < Granite::ORM::Base
  adapter sqlite
  table_name post_comments
  field name : String
  field body : Text
end
```

### id, created_at, updated_at

The primary key is automatically created for you and if you use `timestamps` they will be
automatically updated for you.

Here are the MySQL field definitions for id, created_at, updated_at

```mysql
  id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
  # Your fields go here
  created_at TIMESTAMP
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
```

### Custom Primary Key

For legacy database mappings, you may already have a table and the primary key is not named `id` or `Int64`.

We have a macro called `primary` to help you out:

```crystal
class Site < Granite::ORM::Base
  adapter mysql
  primary custom_id : Int32
  field name : String
end
```

This will override the default primary key of `id : Int64`.

### SQL

To clear all the rows in the database:
```crystal
Post.clear #truncate the table
```

#### Find All

```crystal
posts = Post.all
if posts
  posts.each do |post|
    puts post.name
  end
end
```

#### Find

```crystal
post = Post.find 1
if post
  puts post.name
end
```

#### Find By

```crystal
post = Post.find_by :slug, "example_slug"
if post
  puts post.name
end
```

#### Insert

```crystal
post = Post.new
post.name = "Granite ORM Rocks!"
post.body = "Check this out."
post.save
```

#### Update

```crystal
post = Post.find 1
post.name = "Granite Really Rocks!"
post.save
```

#### Delete

```crystal
post = Post.find 1
post.destroy
puts "deleted" unless post
```

### Queries

The where clause will give you full control over your query.

When using the `all` method, the SQL selected fields will always match the
fields specified in the model.

Always pass in parameters to avoid SQL Injection.  Use a `?`
in your query as placeholder. Checkout the [Crystal DB Driver](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db)
for documentation of the drivers.

Here are some examples:
```crystal
posts = Post.all("WHERE name LIKE ?", ["Joe%"])
if posts
  posts.each do |post|
    puts post.name
  end
end

# ORDER BY Example
posts = Post.all("ORDER BY created_at DESC")

# JOIN Example
posts = Post.all("JOIN comments c ON c.post_id = post.id
                  WHERE c.name = ?
                  ORDER BY post.created_at DESC",
                  ["Joe"])

```

### Relationships

`belongs_to` and `has_many` macros provide a rails like mapping between Objects.

```crystal
class User < Granite::ORM::Base
  adapter mysql
  
  has_many :posts
  
  field email : String
  field name : String
  timestamps
end
```
This will add a `posts` instance method to the user which returns an array of posts.

```
class Post < Granite::ORM::Base
  adapter mysql

  belongs_to :user
  
  field title : String
  timestamps
end
```
This will add a `user` and `user=` methods to the post which returns and sets the user. This also adds a field `user_id : Int64` to the field mapping.  

In this example, you will need to add a `user_id` and index to your posts table:
```mysql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id BIGINT,
  title VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX 'user_id_idx' ON TABLE posts (user_id);
```

### Errors

All database errors are added to the `errors` array used by Granite::ORM::Validators with the symbol ':base'
```
post = Post.new
post.save
post.errors[0].to_s.should eq "ERROR: name cannot be null"
```

### Callbacks

There is support for callbacks on certain events.

Here is an example:
```crystal
require "granite_orm/adapter/pg"

class Post < Granite::ORM
  adapter pg

  before_save :upcase_title

  field title : String
  field content : String
  timestamps

  def upcase_title
    if title = @title
      @title = title.upcase
    end
  end
end
```

You can register callbacks for the following events:

#### Create

- before_save
- before_create
- **save**
- after_create
- after_save

#### Update

- before_save
- before_update
- **save**
- after_update
- after_save

#### Destroy

- before_destroy
- **destroy**
- after_destroy
