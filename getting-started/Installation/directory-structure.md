# Amber Application Directory Structure

This will give a high level overview of the files and directories generated by the `amber new` command. When you use the `amber new` command to create your application, it creates the entire directory structure for the application. Amber knows where to find things it needs within this structure, so you don't have to provide any input.

* **/config** - This directory contains the small amount of configuration code that your application will need, including your database configuration, environment structure, routing of incoming web requests, deployment settings.
  * `application.cr` - Application settings
